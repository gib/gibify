Gilbert Ronald Reimsch√ºssel. That's my name. It's big. It's German. Elbow to
elbow on my high school hockey jersey. I go by Gib.

[How Many of Me.com](http://howmanyofme.com/search/) suggests out of 321,863,829
in the last US census, there are fewer than 1,609 people in the US with the
first name Gib and 143,229 with the first name Gilbert.
I assure the reader that I am a 100% Verified Gib&trade;

`gib.com` was taken, so I'm sticking with github pages where I have actually had `gib` as a username for 
too many years to count. That's something. And if you're looking to unload `gib.com`,
Gulf International Bank, you know where to find me!
