Gilbert Ronald Reimsch√ºssel. That's my name. It's big. It's German. Elbow to
elbow on my high school hockey jersey. I go by Gib. `gib.com` was taken
(unless you're looking to unload it Gulf International Bank?) and
gibify.com was not. I did consider `bigbackwards.com`, and used to have
`shortforgilbert.com`&mdash;domain name availability checking certainly rustles
more than its share of jimmies.

[How Many of Me.com](http://howmanyofme.com/search/) suggests out of 321,863,829
in the last US census, there are fewer than 1,609 people in the US with the
first name Gib and 143,229 with the first name Gilbert.
I assure the reader that I am 100% Verified Gib&trade;

This site&hellip;page, is built with [Harp](http://harpjs.com/).
The Make file's `release` command handles the compilation and git work to put
the compiled contents to the `gh-pages` branch.

This site used to be available at `shortforgilbert.com`. Long story short, I
missed the renewal and didn't want to pay 1&1's fee on principle. I was never
able to re-register it on the open market and some joker got it and put a web
store that Calvin Klein Trademark Trust shut down. The lulz of the interwebs.
