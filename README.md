# gib is short for gilbert... dot com

Gilbert Ronald Reimschüssel. That's my name. It's big. It's German. Elbow to
elbow on my high school hockey jersey. I go by Gib. gib.com was taken
(unless you're looking to unload it Gulf International Bank?) and
shortforgilbert.com was not. I did consider bigbackwards.com&hellip;Domain name
availability checking certainly rustles more than its fare share of jimmies.

[How Many of Me.com](http://howmanyofme.com/search/) suggests out of 321,863,829
in the last US census, there are fewer than 1,609 people in the US with the
first name Gib and 143,229 with the first name Gilbert.
I assure the reader that I am 100% Verified Gib&trade;

This site&hellip;page, is built with [Harp](http://harpjs.com/) and that project
lives in [its own repository](https://github.com/gib/www.shortforgilbert.com).
The compiled site is served via my [github user page](https://gib.github.io) and
lives in [a separate repository](https://github.com/gib/gib.github.io)
(instead of a `gh-pages` branch). They share the same `README`. So many ways
to do the same thing. Maybe they should be in the same repo. ¯\\_(°\_o)\_/¯

The Make file's `release` command handles the compilation and git work to put
the compiled contents to the `gib.github.io` repository.
