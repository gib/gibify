Gilbert Ronald Reimsch√ºssel. That's my name. It's big. It's German. Elbow to
elbow on my high school hockey jersey. I go by Gib. gib.com was taken
(unless you're looking to unload it Gulf International Bank?) and
shortforgilbert.com was not. I did consider bigbackwards.com&hellip;Domain name
availability checking certainly rustles more than its fare share of jimmies.

[How Many of Me.com](http://howmanyofme.com/search/) suggests out of 321,863,829
in the last US census, there are fewer than 1,609 people in the US with the
first name Gib and 143,229 with the first name Gilbert.
I assure the reader that I am 100% Verified Gib&trade;
